# List of exercises to practice use of `lambda` functions

There is only few of these exercises. Lambda functions are used also in exercises on higher order functions. To further practice lambda functions, solve these exercises as well.

1. Write a function which returns a lambda expression calculating square number of the number received as an input. The wrapping function itself does not receive any parameter.

2. Write a function which returns a lambda expression which returns a string (received as a parameter) transformed to upper cahracters.

3. Write a function which returns a lambda expression which returns Nth power of a number received as parameter. Lambda expression receives two parameters: a number to be transformed to power and exponent.

4. Write a function which returns a lambda expression which returns Nth power of a number received as parameter. The number N is parameter of the wrapping function and not of the lambda expression.

5. Write a function which returns a lambda expression which calls a method on an object. The lambda expression receives the object as the first parameter and te number of the method as string in the second parameter.
