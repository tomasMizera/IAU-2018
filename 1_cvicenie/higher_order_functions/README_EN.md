# List of exercises to practice use of functions `map`, `reduce` and `filter`

In some exercises, it is advisable to use `lambda` expression.

1. Write a function which will transform a list of numbers to a list ot their respective squared values using `map` function.

2. Write a function which will select only even numbers from a list of numbers using `filter` function.
 
3. Write a function which will transform a list of temperature values from degrees of Celsius to degrees of Fahreheit.

4. Write a function which will select replicas by king Arthur from transcript of the show "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" stored in the file '../data/holy_grail.txt'.

5. Clean replicas from previous exercise from white spaces at the end of lines and from the name of the character at the beginning of the line.

6. Count number of lines of file '../data/holy_grail.txt' using functions `map` and `reduce`.

7. Count the number of words per line in the same file (you won't need reduce for this exercise). 

8. Count number of words in the entire file.

9. Using the function `reduce`, write a function which will return the biggest element from a list.

10. Using the function `reduce`, write a function which will return average of elemens in a list.

11. Write a function which will return a standard deviation of numbers in an array. [help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)

12. Use function `reduce` to transform a two-dimensional list into a one-dimensional list, where nested lists of the original list are concatenated in the resulting list

13. Use function `reduce` and inicialization of an empty counter (class Counter) to count occurrences of different words in file '../data/holy_grail.txt'. [help](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter)

Next, solve exercises on list comprehention using functions `map`, `reduce` and `filter`.
