# List of exercises to practice list comprehension

This list contains exercises for accessing items in arrays and list comprehension as well.

## Accessing items in list
[help](http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/working-with-data.html)

1. Write a fnction which returns the first element from a list.

2. Write a fnction which returns the last element from a list. Don't use the information about length of the list.

3. Write a fnction which returns elements from index a to b (including). Don't use iteration over the list.

4. Write a fnction which returns all elements from the list except first two. Don't use iteration over the list.

5. Write a fnction which returns all elements from the list except last three. Don't use iteration over the list.

6. Write a fnction which returns elements from the list on pair indexes. Don't use iteration over the list.

7. Write a fnction which transforms all numbers in a list to its squared value.

8. Write a fnction which will increment all numbers in a list by 1.

9. Write a fnction which selects even numbers from a list.

10. Write a fnction which will return a list of multiples of number 3 but not 6, smaller than number N received as parameter of the function.

11. Write a fnction which will return the first character of every word in a sentence. Function receives the sentence as one string.

12. Write a function which will return a set of all unique consonants in a sentence.

13. Replace all vowels in a sentence by the symbol '0'.

14. Using two connected list comprehensions transform two lists into one list of pairs. Create all possible combinations of pairs where the first element is from the first list and the second element is from the second list.

15. Write a function which will return all possible combinations you can obtain by rolling two dices. You can not distinguis these two dices.

16. Write a function which will return a two-dimensional list with dimensions set according to attributes `dim1, dim2` and which will initialzia values in the two-dimensional list to `None` or a value set by the third optional parametyer.

17. Write a function returning a list of all two-item combinations of items from a list (with repetition, the order is important).

18. Write a function returning a list of all two-item combinations of items from a list (without repetition, the order is important).

19. Write a function which will find all Pytagorean triplets of numbers `(x,y,z)` smaller than `N`. Pytagorean triplets are numbers for which the expression `x*x + y*y == z*z` is correct.
